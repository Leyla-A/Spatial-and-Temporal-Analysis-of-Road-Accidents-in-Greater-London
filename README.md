# Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Road Accidents in Greater London
**Abstract** â€” We analyse road accident data for Greater London between the years 2018 and 2020 for this study. We
applied temporal and spatial analyses to find patterns in the data. Our analyses show that Westminster and Camden
boroughs have large density of traffic accident hotspots. We see positive relationship between the speed limit of the
road and the costliness of the accidents and report that the slip roads have higher casualties per accidents among
the junction types. Temporal analyses of data produce that weekday rush hours have more casualties from vehicle
accidents, and we see seasonal maximums of the casualties on Fridays of the summer months.
